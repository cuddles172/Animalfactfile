<h2>INTRO</h2>
<h4>While these animals vary drastically in appearance, every dog—rom the Chihuahua to the Great Dane—is a member of the same species, Canis familiaris. This separates domestic dogs from wild canines, such as coyotes, foxes, and wolves.</h4>
<h2>HABITAT</h2>
<h4>Dogs live in many habitats, including prairies, deserts, grasslands, forests, rain forests, coastal regions and arctic zones. Dogs are highly adaptable, yet some evolved for specific environments, such as breeds that developed heavy coats to withstand freezing climates.</h4>
<h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
<h4> Research indicates that dogs have personality traits such as calmness, boldness, trainability and sociability. Dogs know how to listen to their owners because they have adapted from being brought up in packs where everyone listens to the leader</h4>
<h2>DIET</h2>
<h4>While meat makes up the majority of their diet, domestic dogs can also derive nutrients from grains, fruits, and vegetables. These non-meat foods are not simply fillers, but can be a valuable source of essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. A good dog food will contain meat, vegetables, grains, and fruits.Research indicates that dogs have personality traits such as calmness, boldness, trainability and sociability.

<h2>LIFESPAN</h2>
<h4>Sadly, dogs don't live as long as people. The average lifespan of a dog is between 10 and 13 years, but some can live much longer. To determine the dog breeds that have the longest life expectancy, 24/7 Tempo reviewed the life expectancy of nearly 300 dog breeds listed by the American Kennel Club. </h4>
